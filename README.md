# summarizer
My initial attempts with extractive text summarization.

## "summarizer.py"
* This is the original code of mine for extractive text summarization; and
* As my first try with NLP to any extent (i.e. using NLTK), I'd like to think I'm off to a good start.
  * Let me know if I'm wrong.

## "_summarizer_demo.py"
* This is simply code taken from the link in the description. I used it to help derive my original code.

## "/resources"
* Just a directory containing mostly .txt files of documents I'd like to summarize. I'll be adding to this folder as I find more articles and reports.
